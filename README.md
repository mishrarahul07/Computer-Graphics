An OpenGL simulation of solar trajectory and lunar eclipse in C++

The simulation consists of two options where ‘R’ is used to show the condition of solar eclipse and ‘S’ is used to show the condition of solar eclipse. Other than that, the earth is continuously moving around the sun and the moon is continuously moving around the earth. The flow of the program on various inputs is given below –
[Keyboard] Type ‘R’ or ‘r’:
• Solar eclipse will be shown.
[Keyboard] Type ‘S’ or ‘s’:
• Lunar eclipse will be shown.
[Keyboard] (Up key):
• Increase the speed of the earth around sun and moon around the sun.
[Keyboard] (Down key):
• Decrease the speed of the earth around sun and moon around the sun.
[Keyboard] (Esc key):
• Exit the program.
The scenery is designed according to the time of the day (Modes) which are described as follows –
Initially, the earth is moving around the axis of the earth and the moon is moving around the earth. We have an option to control the speed of the sun and moon. We can control the speed using the up and down key. If we want to see the condition of the solar eclipse, we can press the key ‘R’ or ‘r’ and if we want to see the condition of the lunar eclipse, we can press the key ‘S’ or ‘s’. On pressing the above keys, the earth and moon will stop and we will be able to see the condition of the sun.
Condition of Solar eclipse: At a point, the moon comes between the earth and the sun.
Condition of Lunar eclipse: At a point, the earth comes between the moon and the sun.
